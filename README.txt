Getting started
----------------------
To compile the OS, you must have a flash drive or second hard drive with the drive letter set to W:
The build environment looks for things in this letter. This can be changed, but is very time consuming if you don't want to change drive letters.

The Windows version used to compile doesn't matter, as long as it is not Windows 1.x to NT 3.5. 

I recommend 2000 or later as it supports larger hard drives and flash drives (up to 2 terabytes)


Have fun!
